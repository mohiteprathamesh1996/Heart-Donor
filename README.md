# Heart-Donor
If you’ve ever been enthralled by the idea of having life after death, there’s a high probability of you encountering a person who is living a second life. Thanks to the phenomenal efforts made by medical researchers around the globe, that have given rise to advanced surgical procedures and finally made organ donation and transplantation a reality. However, despite having 90 percent of US adults support for organ donation, less than 60 percent of them actually sign up as a registered donor. Further statistics indicate the increasing rate of waiting list of recipients by 1 person every 9 minutes, with an average of 17 deaths per day the lives which could have been saved had they received the transplant at the right moment.
This project is an attempt to utilize the potential of large scale multi-objective optimization to devise a mechanism that efficiently pairs potential donors with their recipients ensuring maximum compatibility in a minimum timeframe and a high post-surgical survival rate.
